    <h2 class="about__title">The story</h2>
    <p class="about__text"> Once upon the time... Honestly that's a lie. It was in this summer semester at AGH University. For the purpose of Python In The Enterprise course we decided to make a useful project (mostly for us (ok, some young programmers can also use it)). So here an idea of creating JobAid comes. Blood, sweat, and tears were the price which we all have paid to build such a great website. Honestly that's another lie. All of our team had an hours of a good time. Time full of laugh, crazy bugs and watching tutorials of youtubers with Hindu accent (some of us even have taken over this accent).<br /><br /></p>
    <p class="about__text"> But to be a little more serious with you this project is a result of cooperation of 5 great programmers (still the part with Hindu accent is honest truth). Working with the Scrum we were doing parts of a project step by step, task by task. The mode of work which we have chosen was constantly improved for the purpose of merging our daily duties and abilities of each participant. Our Team leader was online 24/7 to help us with every single bug (or mental problem) which unfortunately can't be described with words. Teammates were constantly helping each other also and searching for usefull informations. <br /><br /></p>
    <p class="about__text"> *heavy sigh* enough being so serious... Here are stages which were made in this project:<br/><br/></p>
    <p class="about__headers"> Stage 1: Scrapers<br/></p>
    <p class="about__text"> Legally or not we had to feed the ML algorithms with data (pretty gluttonous beast!). Data which had to be provided should be felxible and tailored to the needs. So here we start with stage 1. Each of participant found his favourite webisite with job offers and scrap as many as it was possible. Task seemed simple, however creativity of HR workes is deeper than a supermassive black hole. Seriously, it is... The number of special cases which have occured made us to manage even more creative solitions than HR's do. </p>
    <p class="about__headers"> Stage 2: Building a wbsite <br/></p>
    <p class="about__text"> Based on completely new for us tool - Django - we have build whole of backend and frontend from scratch. The part with Front-end... Let's leave it with only one sentence: WE ARE NOT UX DESIGNERS. However the part with backend took as a great amount of time. Creating models, forms and querying database... Finding solutions for this issues made us to learn many new tools which was quite interesting.<br/><br/></p>
    <p class="about__headers"> Stage 3: ML <br/></p>
    <p class="about__text"> Here's the most exciting and curious part - machine learning. <br/>(to be done by ADRIAN FURMAN & MATEUSZ GÓRCZANY) <br/>(EDIT - it has been already done in another report :D)<br/><br/></p>
    <p class="about__headers">Stage 4: Launch<br/></p>
    <p class="about__text">Through stars, through deep web, through dark net, through the second page of Google search... The project would fly for years since it is available on GitHub. <br/><br/></p>
    <p class="about__importatnt__note">IMPOTANT NOTE: JobAid is done only for purpose of learning and Python In The Enterprise course.<br/><br/></p>
    <p class="about__text">Having all things considered: great project, great people, fun and gaining knowlage. Could there be something more valueable? <br/><br/></p>
